	<h1> LIONS </h1>
	<p>The Al Osh Wild Circus is proud to present six wonderful African lions. Raised in captivity, with lots of love and tenderness, our lions have been 
	tamed differently. No more whips or sticks or violence. Instead, our lion dompter, Hasam Al Hokaini, uses love, patience and treats. That's what makes 
	our lions and our lion spectacle so different and unique.</p>
	
	<p>Our lions, Simba, Jumbo, Hakili, Timbo and Baloo, will delight you and your children with their jumps, roars, strength and intelligence.
	You will see first-hand how magnificent these big cats are. </p>

	<p>Of course, none of this would have been possible without the wonderful training of Hasam Al Hokaini, our Somalian lion tamer who through
	years of patience and hard work has achieved a real relationship based on love and trust with his lions.</>
