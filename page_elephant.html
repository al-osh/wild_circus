	<h1> ELEPHANTS</h1>
	<p>The Al Osh Wild Circus is proud to present six wonderful African elephants. Raised in captivity, with lots of love and tenderness, our elephants have been 
	tamed differently. No more whips or sticks or violence. Instead, our elephant trainer, Djibril Mandanda, uses love, patience and treats. That's what makes 
	our elephants and our elephant spectacle so different and unique.</p>
	
	<p>Our elephants Dumbo, Fanta, Bama, Koné, Pelé and Kunta, will delight you and your children with their strength, intelligence, .
	You will see first-hand how magnificent these big animals are. </p>

	<p>Of course, none of this would have been possible without the wonderful training of Djibril Mandanda, our Kenian lion tamer who through
	years of patience and hard work has achieved a real relationship based on love and trust with his elephants.</>
