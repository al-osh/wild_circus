	<h1> TIGERS</h1>
	<p>The Al Osh Wild Circus is proud to present six wonderful Russian tigers. Raised in captivity, with lots of love and tenderness, our tigers have been 
	tamed differently. No more whips or sticks or violence. Instead, our tiger trainer, Djibril Mandanda, uses love, patience and treats. That's what makes 
	our tigers and our tiger spectacle so different and unique.</p>
	
	<p>Our tigers Igor, Pushkin, Vladi, Dima, Oleg and Anton will delight you and your children with their strength, intelligence, .
	You will see first-hand how magnificent these big animals are. </p>

	<p>Of course, none of this would have been possible without the wonderful training of Pavel Kiliakov, our Russian tiger tamer who through
	years of patience and hard work has achieved a real relationship based on love and trust with his tigers.</>
